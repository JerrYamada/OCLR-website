# Streaming read API (#540)

The website provides edition-bound, read-only access for an explicitly granted
Streamer. Overlay integration is deferred until its upstream update; this change
does not modify OCLR-stream-overlay, tosu, OBS or official results.

## Operator workflow

Sign in on the website and open **Streaming tasks → Streaming API access**
(`/streaming/{edition}`). Choose the exact local origin and create access. Copy the
credential once into the local application's server-side credential input. Never
put it in an OBS URL, browser storage, source code, screenshots or logs. The page
lists only the current user's credentials for that edition and supports revocation.

A live edition-scoped or global `streamer` grant is required. Admin, Developer and
repository access alone do not qualify. The credential has only `streaming:read`,
is bound to one edition and cannot access other Developer resources or mutations.

Access uses a **one-hour idle lease**, not a fixed one-hour lifetime. A successful
Streaming GET, including an empty next-fixture response, renews it. HEAD, OPTIONS,
invalid queries, failed authorization, serialization errors and rate limits do not.
Activity writes are coalesced to at most one per minute, so the persisted idle
boundary can precede the last successful GET by less than one minute. Normal
15-second polling keeps it active. Renewal can never exceed the original browser
session expiry. Expired access cannot be revived; create a new credential.
Revocation, role withdrawal and logout take effect on subsequent requests.
The displayed expiry is a snapshot; reload the access page for the latest lease.

Credential issuance/list/revocation uses the existing same-origin browser session:
`POST /api/streaming/tokens` with `{ editionSlug, origin }`,
`GET /api/streaming/tokens?edition=...`, and
`DELETE /api/streaming/tokens/{tokenId}`. No bearer credential can issue or revoke
credentials. Owners can revoke their own access even after losing Streamer.
Credential hashes and audit metadata are stored separately from business records;
raw tokens are never stored. Issuance is limited to 5/minute and 10 active tokens
per subject; reads use the existing process-local 120/minute credential budget.

## Read contract

`GET /api/v1/streaming/tournaments/{edition}/next?afterFixtureId={uuid}`

Requires `Authorization: Bearer <credential>`. The response uses saved-read
contract **1.4.0**, `X-OCLR-Read-Contract`, `Cache-Control: no-store` and the existing
`{ data, meta: { apiVersion: "1", requestId } }` envelope. HEAD has the same checks
and no body; OPTIONS is read-only preflight. Writes return 405 `READ_ONLY`.

`data` has exactly three properties:

| Property      | Source and semantics                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `nextFixture` | Existing `PublicFixture` from `publicCompetition`, or null. Only published fixture/identity projections, never staff assignment history.                                                                        |
| `stage`       | `{ id, kind, round: { id, name, position, scoringRules } }`, or null. `id`/`kind` are the existing tournament stage; `round` is the fixture's exact tournament round. No group configuration or private policy. |
| `mappools`    | Existing `publicMappools` projection for the fixture's explicitly linked, published pool. Empty when absent/unpublished; never another pool in the round.                                                       |

Stage has no independent display name in the current database. Round names remain
literal. `scoringRules` is the existing nullable scoring model: `first_to.wins` or
`fixed_maps.count` is authoritative; clients must not infer BO from round names.
Existing timestamps and map metadata remain unchanged. Read schema/OpenAPI are
generated from the shared TypeScript models.

For Developer parity, `GET /api/v1/me/tournaments/{edition}/streaming/next` uses
exactly the same generated response schema and service. It requires the ordinary
Developer token with `identity:read` **and** the subject's live Streamer grant;
it does not accept streaming tokens or renew their leases. PublicFixture and
Mappool objects also retain the shape of their existing Developer resources.

## Selection and consistency

Selection is restricted to the subject's current assignments in the requested
published edition. Candidates must have a public scheduled timestamp. Past-time
unfinished fixtures remain eligible (delays); sorting is timestamp, fixture
position, then ID. Cancelled fixtures, approved-result fixtures and fixtures whose
saved referee event projection has completed the series are excluded, including
before results are publicly released. No private completion details are returned.
Unpublished direct team identities withhold a fixture through the existing public
projection; published TBD progression slots retain their existing semantics.

`afterFixtureId` is an optional read-only anchor in this ordered, public, assigned
set, including a completed/cancelled anchor with a schedule. Invalid, unpublished,
unscheduled, foreign-edition or reassigned anchors return 404; they do not fall
back to the first fixture. The anchor does not complete a fixture or save progress.
Without an anchor an ongoing match can remain the first unfinished assignment.

No next fixture returns `nextFixture: null, stage: null, mappools: []`. A missing
public pool does not suppress an otherwise visible fixture. The three projections
are read in one read-only repeatable-read transaction, using the existing services.
Only credential lease bookkeeping writes after a successful response is prepared;
no business record, provider cache or published result is modified by this API.

## Transport and future Overlay adapter

The preferred client is the Overlay's Node service. It sends no browser cookies
and keeps the token server-side. Server requests without Origin are authenticated
normally. Direct browser reads additionally require an exact allowed loopback
origin and `credentials: "omit"`. Configure `OCLR_STREAMING_ORIGINS` (comma-separated,
up to 20); defaults are `http://127.0.0.1:3001,http://localhost:3001`. Origins must
also match the credential's bound origin. No wildcard, reflected or null origins.
Upstream transport must be HTTPS outside explicit local test environments.

```js
// Token supplied in memory by the operator; never a URL or logged configuration.
const response = await fetch(
  `${backend}/api/v1/streaming/tournaments/${edition}/next`,
  {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`, Accept: "application/json" },
    redirect: "error",
    cache: "no-store",
    signal: AbortSignal.timeout(8000),
  },
);
// Validate the contract header and OpenAPI response before applying any data.
// Production clients must additionally bound streamed response bytes (2 MiB).
```

Poll every 15 seconds with one request in flight. Respect 429 `Retry-After`; back
off on network/5xx failures. Stop and clear protected source data on 401/403; never
fall back to anonymous access. An operator-confirmed local match may remain on
screen, marked stale, but polling must not overwrite its teams, BP, scores, stage
corrections or referenced maps. Applying the next fixture is an explicit local
operator action. Empty data never imports historic-season defaults.

Errors retain `{ error: { code, message, requestId } }`; use `code`, not text.
400 is invalid query, 401 expired/revoked/wrong credential family, 403 missing
Streamer/edition/origin/scope, 404 hidden/missing edition or anchor, 413 oversized
response, 429 throttling and sanitized 5xx service failure. Invalid Bearer access
never falls back to cookies or anonymous reads.

## Deployment and verification

Apply migration `0061_streaming_api_access` through the approved operator workflow
before using the API. It adds dedicated credential/audit tables; existing Developer
tokens and expiry policies are unchanged. This implementation does not grant real
roles, issue real credentials or deploy. Synthetic database/browser evidence and
commit-specific CI are recorded on #540; real Overlay/OBS integration is pending.
