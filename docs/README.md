# OCLR documentation

The repository root README ([English](../README.md) / [简体中文](../README.zh-Hans.md) / [繁體中文](../README.zh-Hant.md)) contains the project overview, a quick start and common commands. Detailed technical and operational material is organized here by responsibility.

**Where to start:** use [Development](development.md) to work locally, [Tournament administration](tournament-management.md) to understand enrollment and permissions, and [Deployment](deployment.md) for running or updating production. Never use production credentials or personal registration records in tests.

- [CI coverage and acceptance](ci.md) — core/full lanes, scope selection, main checks and maintainer workflow.

## Developer read API and remote frontend

- [Known player identities and name evidence](player-identity.md) — UID aggregation,
  publication boundaries, migration/backfill and the additive v1.3 profile resources (#360).

- [Remote setup and troubleshooting](remote-development.md) — fresh frontend without a local DB/OAuth secret.
- [Full coverage and service boundaries](remote-coverage.md), [generated page/module inventory](remote-coverage.json).
- [Read API contract and browser/SSR examples](read-api.md), [OpenAPI](read-api.openapi.json).
- [Developer grant, short-lived access and exact-origin CORS](developer-api.md).

Local synthetic acceptance and actual CI are recorded per commit on #271/#272;
real grants/OAuth/deployment and new Chinese wording acceptance remain separate.

- [Published match details](match-details.md) — source/review/public projection matrix, revision consistency and verification boundaries (#283).

## Referee desktop integration design

- [Referee panel and OCLR-ref-tools integration](referee-panel-integration.md) — shared panel data, desktop Bearer scopes, proposed read/write APIs, revision/idempotency, IRC execution boundaries and phased delivery (#312–#317). Design draft only; not a deployed endpoint or permission expansion. The same document is maintained in OCLR-ref-tools.

## Historical source preparation

- [OCLR β (S5) sources](s5-archive.md) — MainSheet-authoritative rosters,
  separate draft screenshot, 34 recorded source scores and four mappools;
  preparation only, with identity/date/rule uncertainties tracked (#288).
- [S6 surviving sources and missing evidence](s6-archive.md) — source review,
  original artwork and format 2 organizer-confirmed package; S6 is imported and
  published, with remaining source/result review items recorded separately (#289).
- [S6 match and bracket reconstruction](s6-match-reconstruction.md) — corrected
  2021 MP histories, preliminary/knockout tables, replay and format uncertainties.
- [S7 archive](s7-archive.md), [S8 archive](s8-archive.md),
  [S9 archive](s9-archive.md), [S10 archive](s10-archive.md).

- [OCL Chess](ocl-chess.md) — shared pixel canvas, permissions, persistence and verification scope (#379).

- [Streaming API](streaming-api.md) — edition-bound Streamer access, one-hour idle
  lease, next fixture/pool/stage contract and future Overlay integration (#540).
